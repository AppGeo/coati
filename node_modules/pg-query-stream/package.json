  "readme": "# pg-query-stream\n\nReceive result rows from [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) as a readable (object) stream.\n\nThis module __only works with the pure JavaScript client__.\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install pg\n$ npm install pg-query-stream\n```\n\n_requires pg>=2.8.1_\n\n##### - or -\n\n```bash\n$ npm install pg.js\n$ npm install pg-query-stream\n```\n\n_requires pg.js>=2.8.1_\n\n## use\n\n```js\nvar pg = require('pg')\nvar QueryStream = require('pg-query-stream')\nvar JSONStream = require('JSONStream')\n\n//pipe 1,000,000 rows to stdout without blowing up your memory usage\npg.connect(function(err, client, done) {\n  if(err) throw err;\n  var query = new QueryStream('SELECT * FROM generate_series(0, $1) num', [1000000])\n  var stream = client.query(query)\n  //release the client when the stream is finished\n  stream.on('end', done)\n  stream.pipe(JSONStream.stringify()).pipe(process.stdout)\n})\n```\n\nThe stream uses a cursor on the server so it efficiently keeps only a low number of rows in memory.\n\nThis is especially useful when doing [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) on a huge table.  Using manual `limit` and `offset` queries to fake out async itteration through your data is cumbersom, and _way way way_ slower than using a cursor.\n\n## contribution\n\nI'm very open to contribution!  Open a pull request with your code or idea and we'll talk about it.  If it's not way insane we'll merge it in too: isn't open source awesome?\n\n## license\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Brian M.
